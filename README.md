#K Nearest Neighbors Algorithm

The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, easy-to-implement supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems. The KNN algorithm assumes that similar things exist in close proximity. In other words, similar things are near to each other.

Implementing KNN clasiifier and plotting a scatter graph using matplotlib.

A **scatter plot** (also called a scatterplot, scatter graph, scatter chart, scattergram, or scatter diagram) is a type of plot or mathematical diagram using Cartesian coordinates to display values for typically two variables for a set of data.
